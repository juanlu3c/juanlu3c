## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, welcome to my GitHub profile!

### :raising_hand_man: Who I am?
Let me introduce myself, my name is Juan Luis Sanz and I am from Madrid (Spain). Currently,
I am studying a Computer Engineering Degree at Escuela PolitÃ©cnica Superior, in Universidad
AutÃ³noma de Madrid. 

It is a pleasure to have you here, investigate everything you want in my profile. If you need 
to contact me, do not hesitate to do so at the following email: [juanlu.sc56@gmail.com](mailto:juanlu.sc56@gmail.com)

### :scroll: What I am working on?
I am currently doing an internship at a spanish company named Aqua eSolutions, as well as studying
for finishing this year(I hope) the degree and become a computer engineer.
Also, I am developing my Final Degree Project (TFG) which proposes the design and implementation of 
an heterogeneous distributed system for fire detection and further notification to the users. It is 
currently in the development phase and is still private, but I will publish it when finished.

### :warning: Disclaimer
In this repository you will find many of the practices carried out in the different subjects of 
the degree. This does not mean that they are completely correct, and, of course, their copying 
is strictly prohibited, subject to the possible consequences on the part of the school. Neither I 
nor any of the collaborators are responsible for the misuse of these practices since their main 
objective is didactic, to serve as guidance, and not as a plagiarism tool.
