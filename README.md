### :warning: Disclaimer
In this repository you will find many of the practices carried out in the different subjects of 
the degree. This does not mean that they are completely correct, and, of course, their copying 
is strictly prohibited, subject to the possible consequences on the part of the school. Neither I 
nor any of the collaborators are responsible for the misuse of these practices since their main 
objective is didactic, to serve as guidance, and not as a plagiarism tool.
