## Who I am?

Let me introduce myself, my name is Juan Luis Sanz and I am from Madrid (Spain). Currently,
I am studying a Computer Engineering Degree at Escuela Polit√©cnica Superior, in Universidad
Aut√≥noma de Madrid. 

It is a pleasure to have you here, investigate everything you want in my profile. If you need 
to contact me, do not hesitate to do so at the following email: [juanlu.sc56@gmail.com](mailto:juanlu.sc56@gmail.com)

## What I am working on?
I am currently doing an internship at a spanish company named Aqua eSolutions, as well as studying
for finishing this year(I hope) the degree and become a computer engineer.

## :warning: Disclaimer
In this repository you will find many of the practices carried out in the different subjects of 
the degree. This does not mean that they are completely correct, and, of course, their copying 
is strictly prohibited, subject to the possible consequences on the part of the School. Neither I 
nor any of the collaborators are responsible for the misuse of these practices since their main 
objective is didactic, to serve as guidance, and not as a plagiarism tool.

En este repositorio encontrar√°s muchas de las pr√°cticas realizadas en las diferentes asignaturas 
del grado. Ello no indica que est√©n correctas en su totalidad, y, por supuesto, queda terminantemente 
prohibida su copia, ateni√©ndose a las posibles consecuencias por parte de la Escuela. Ni yo ni 
ninguno de los colaboradores nos responsabilizamos del mal uso de estas pr√°cticas ya que su objetivo 
principal es did√°ctico, para servir de orientaci√≥n, y no como herramienta de plagio.
